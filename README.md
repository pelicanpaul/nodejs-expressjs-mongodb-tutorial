Just a Great NODE.JS, EXPRESS, JADE, AND MONGODB Tutorial Part 3.
The last step of Christopher Buecheler outstanding tutorial. Here I complete the lesson with the last part of the CRUD operation with the UPDATE step. While this tutorial does not program in a very modular, best practices way, it does explain the basics really well
